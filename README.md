# sql-challenge
UNCC Data Science Bootcamp - Module 9 SQL

The purpose of this challenge is to use Postgres SQL to create a Database with 6 csv files and  perform the following tasks:

## 1 - Data modeling
An Entity Relationship Diagram of the 6 csv files was done using QuickDBD application. In the "ERD" folder you will find
an image showing the resulting diagram (QuickDBD-EmployeeSQL2.png). Additionally, I have added the resulting ProgressSQL
ERD (Postgres_ERD_EmployeeSQL2.png).

## 2 - Data engineering
The resulting SQL source file from QuickDBD was exported as a PostgresSQL file (QuickDBD-EmployeeSQL2) and used to create the 
tables. Some editing was necessary to follow the PostgresSQL syntax and the final code file is attached (tables_creation.sql). 
The Import/Export function in PostgresSQL was used to input the data from the csv files into the tables.

## 3 - Data analysis 
Eight different queries were run to complete the Data Analysis. The Query code file is attached (Data_analysis_Query).
Additionally, images of the Query results were captured and attached in the folder "Data_Analysis_Images" folder.
